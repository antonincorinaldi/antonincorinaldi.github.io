  <h2>About me</h2>
  
  <p> I am post-master intern in cosmology in the CosmoStat team of the Department of Astrophysics of CEA.
    My research is centered on the intrinsic alignments of galaxies in the Universe and I will continue to work on this topic during a PhD thesis that will start on October.

    <br>
    I obtained my Master's degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics at Paris Observatory in 2024 and I am currently in post-master professional gap year to realize a long project of research of internship.

    <br>
    Next to science, I am found of sport, especially running, and I love music.
